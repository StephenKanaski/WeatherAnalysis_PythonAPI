Weather_Analysis:

1. Temperature seems to be the only aspect that has a high correlation with 
changing Latitude. As on gets closer to the equator (latitude: 0degrees),
temperature rises. This is true when looking at northern hemisphere cities
and southern hemisphere cities.

2. While I thought humidity would have had a moderate to high correlation with
latitude, the correlation is actually pretty weak. Latitude does not seem to
predict the level of humidity. Looking at the humidity heatmap, humidity seems
to have a greater correlation with proximity to the ocean; however, since this
is based on visual examination and not on statistical analysis, the fitness
of correlation cannot be verified.

3. When looking at the other parameters, cloudiness and wind speed, there 
exists a weak to negligible correlation with changing latitude. Latitude does
not provide a good predictor of level of cloudiness and wind speed.
